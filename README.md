**2Ô∏è‚É£ Birthday Role and Bot Hierarchy**

- BirthdayBot **must have a role above the birthday role** to assign/remove it.  
- Optional permissions:
  - `Manage Roles`: needed to assign/remove birthday roles  
  - `Manage Messages`: needed to pin/update birthday messages  

**Recommended setup:**
1. Create a bot role (e.g., `BirthdayBot`).  
2. Move it **above the birthday role** in the server settings.  
3. Grant optional permissions.  
4. Configure roles via `/setup`.

---

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Admin/Mod Access**

- Admins or users with the configured mod role can use:
  - `/setuserbirthday`  
  - `/deleteuserbirthday`  
  - `/testdate`  
- Regular users can only manage their own birthdays with `/setbirthday` and `/deletebirthday`.

---

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Birthday Handling**

- **GMT+0** is used for all birthday checks.  
- Birthday messages are automatically sent at the configured check hour. (9am UTC is default)
- Feb 29 birthdays are automatically announced on Feb 28 in non-leap years.  
- Pinned birthday messages are updated after adding, removing, or changing birthdays.  

---

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage**

- Stores user IDs, birthdays, and optional guild configuration (roles, channels, check hour).  
- Data is stored locally in `birthdays.db`.  
- No personal data is shared externally.  

---

**6Ô∏è‚É£ Notes and Limitations**

- Use the bot responsibly and within Discord TOS.  
- If the bot cannot assign/remove roles or pin messages, check role hierarchy and permissions.  
- `/testdate` resets the daily tracker so all users can be wished again.
